                    <h5>Stowe trail runs</h5>
                    <p>Whether you have just started running or are an experienced runner, trail running allows you to enjoy the great outdoors. This event is based around Stowe landscape gardens in Buckinghamshire. It starts and finishes at the visitor centre at the New Inn. The scale and beauty of Stowe have attracted visitors for over 300 years. Picture-perfect views, winding paths, lakeside walks and temples create a timeless landscape, reflecting the changing seasons. The course runs you from the New Inn down into the landscape gardens. What a wonderful way to take in the history and landmarks that Stowe is renowned for. It is a safe undulating route and you can enter the one lap (6km) or 2 lap (12km) run. Bring family and friends along to cheer you on and support and celebrate with you at the finish.</p>

                    <h5>Hughenden Manor trail runs</h5>
                    <p>Set in over 600 acres, the estate at Hughenden offers some of the best of the Chilterns countryside, from native beech woodlands to the wide expanses of the chalk hills and valleys. Hughenden Manor has a rich history, it was the country home to Benjamin Disraeli, Queen Victoria's favourite Prime Minister, and was the base for a secret map-making operation during the Second World War. Hughenden is now looked after by the National Trust, Europe’s largest conservation charity, who with the help of supporters, protect and care for special places so people and nature can thrive for generations to come. This makes a wonderful background for the trail run series. The start takes place against the backdrop of the Manor and heads up through the woodlands and across the fields. Coming back in you will run past the gardens and out into the parkland before returning to the start and finish area. The trails are all on established paths and tracks.</p>
